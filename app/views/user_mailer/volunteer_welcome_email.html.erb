      <b>Screening Interview:</b> To ensure a safe and productive environment for our clients and volunteers, 
      we ask that our volunteers undergo a brief screening interview by video. This interview requires no preparation. 
      Feel free to call, text, or email our Volunteer Support Team to schedule. Their contact details are below:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="mailto:<%= ENV['SCREENING_EMAIL_ADDRESS'] %>"><%= ENV['SCREENING_EMAIL_ADDRESS'] %></a><br>
        <a href="tel:<%= ENV['SCREENING_PHONE_NUMBER_ATTRIBUTE'] %>"><%= ENV['SCREENING_PHONE_NUMBER_DISPLAY'] %></a>
      </p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
    <p>
      <b>Background Check:</b>  As mentioned on our FAQ page, all new volunteers must pass a criminal background 
      check at their expense. As of December 2020, our partner, Sterling Volunteers, charges &#36;12 USD for volunteers based 
      in the United States and &#36;30 USD for non-US volunteers. (Pricing may change, so free to reach out to the Volunteer 
      Support Team for an update.) Our Volunteer Support Team will walk you through the process. After the check, if 
      there are no issues, the team will activate your account. You can then proceed to Step 3 below.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
    <p>
      <b>Availabilities:</b> Please enter your availabilities so you appear in clients' search results. Once logged 
      in, this can be done from the Availabilities menu option.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Once Step 3 is complete, clients will be able to reach out to you for help.
